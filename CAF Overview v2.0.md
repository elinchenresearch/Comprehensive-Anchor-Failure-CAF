# Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF) v2.0  
*Version: 2025-09-15

---

## Overview  
**Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)** describes conditions where the foundational anchors of human life are destabilized to the point that no single anchor can reliably stabilize the system.  

Unlike trauma models (event-based) or diagnostic categories (symptom-based), CAF is **structural**: it maps the lattice-wide breakdown of stabilizing anchors and how adaptation emerges under failure.

## Anchor Layers  

### 1. Primary Anchors  
Baseline conditions required for psychological survival:  
- **Survival** – bodily persistence.  
- **Safety** – freedom from constant threat.  
- **Existence** – recognition of continuity and life-weight.  
- **Identity** – coherent sense of “I.”  
- **Trust** – capacity to rely on others/systems.  
- **Dignity** – minimum social self-worth.  
- **Language** – stable medium of meaning.  
- **Agency** – ability to act and not be erased.  
- **Belonging** – connection that does not destroy clarity.  

### 2. Secondary Anchors (Synthetic)  
Formed by combining primaries; collapse if primaries are unstable.  
- **Play / Aesthetic** – joy, creativity, non-instrumental exploration.  
- **Time / Continuity** – linking past, present, future coherently.  
- **Meta / Transcendence** – larger structures (religion, ideology, wager) that buffer chaos.  

### 3. Distorted Anchors  
Arise when anchors function but invert/contaminate meaning.  
- Love as control.  
- Trust as dependency.  
- Dignity as humiliation-avoidance.  

### 4. Synthetic Replacements  
Constructed anchors designed to substitute for compromised primaries.  
- *Epistemic Autarchy* → synthetic survival/clarity.  
- *Wager-as-Process Engine* → meta-anchor after void.  
- *Structural Karma* → loop-based substitute for justice.

## Distinctions  
- **CAF vs Trauma**: Trauma isolates shocks; CAF describes absence and distortion of stabilizers.  
- **CAF vs Diagnosis**: ADHD, autism, PTSD explain traits; CAF explains why overlaps occur structurally.  
- **Baseline Distortion Effect**: Some anchors were never solid from the start, unlike typical trauma which assumes an intact baseline.  

---

## Dynamics  
- **Intensity** – Anchors can fail mildly or catastrophically.  
- **Combination** – Failure patterns (e.g., dignity + trust collapse → paranoia).  
- **Intergenerational Transmission** – Parent’s compromised anchor damages a different anchor in the child.  
- **Culture-Level CAF** – Societies can lose collective anchors, enabling large-scale manipulation.  

---

## Applications (Speculative)  
- **Individual**: Understanding micro-collapses, grief channeling, non-manipulative adaptation.  
- **Family**: Mapping cross-anchor damage between generations.  
- **Culture**: Locating weak anchors in collective systems.  
- **Research**: Integrating with *Epistemic Autarchy*, *Signal Gating*, *Wager-as-Process Engine* as upstream survival frameworks.  

⚠️ *Applications remain speculative and require further testing.*

## Notes  
- CAF is **not a diagnosis**; it is a structural description.  
- Anchors are **hierarchical**: secondary collapse silently if primaries fail.  
- Framework is **growing**; updates will appear as versioned documents (v2.1, v3.0…).

# Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)-V1.0
9 September 2025

**Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)** describes a boundary-condition state where all nine human anchors — survival, safety, existence, identity, trust, dignity, language, agency, belonging — fail through absence, inversion, mutation, or void. This repo documents CAF as the empirical foundation for downstream frameworks such as Epistemic Autarchy, Signal Gating, Structural Karma, and Theorein.

## 📖 Definition
CAF is a systemic model of *anchor failure*: when the core experiential supports for human life are absent, inverted, mutated, or never established (counterfactual void).  
It expands beyond standard “experiential deprivation,” covering **all anchors** across development and lifespan.

## 🧩 The Nine Anchors
1. Survival  
2. Safety  
3. Existence  
4. Identity  
5. Trust  
6. Dignity  
7. Language  
8. Agency  
9. Belonging  

Each anchor can fail by:
- **Absence** (not present)  
- **Inversion** (flipped into harm)  
- **Mutation** (distorted, conditional)  
- **Counterfactual Void** (never existed, yet grieved)  

---

## 🔍 Comparisons
- **Single-event trauma**: 1–2 anchors, extreme depth.  
- **C-PTSD**: 3–4 anchors, medium–high depth.  
- **CAF**: 9 anchors, total breadth, varied intensity.  

CAF functions as a **boundary-condition model**: not common, but uniquely important for testing human survival limits.

## 🕑 Timeline Mapping
CAF can be traced across developmental stages:
- Childhood → early anchor disruptions (identity, existence, dignity)  
- Adolescence → trust and safety failures  
- Young adulthood → agency loss, belonging collapse, detention/exile  

---

## 🔄 Relation to Other Frameworks
- **Epistemic Autarchy** → synthetic anchor replacement  
- **Signal Gating** → substitute filters for trust/language  
- **Structural Karma** → anchor inversions as systemic loops  
- **Theorein** → logic theorem proven after void  
- **Structural Wager** → refusal of collapse after anchors failed  

---

## 📌 Research Positioning
CAF offers:
- A general evaluative tool: all trauma types can be mapped by anchors × modes × intensity.  
- An empirical boundary-condition case study: rare but disproportionately valuable.  
- A foundation for theory + intervention: linking individual survival logic with systemic failure analysis.

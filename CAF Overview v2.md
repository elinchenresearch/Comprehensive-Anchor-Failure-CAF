# Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)

**Version:** 15 Sep 2025

---

## Overview
**Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)** is a framework for understanding how human systems (individual or collective) destabilize when foundational anchors of psychological life are compromised.  

Unlike trauma models that isolate events, CAF describes **systemic failure**: when no single anchor can reliably support stability, the whole lattice becomes fragile.  

CAF grew out of analyzing lived experience where ordinary diagnostic categories (CPTSD, ADHD, dissociation, autism, etc.) could not capture the **baseline absence** or collapse of stabilizing anchors.

## Anchor Hierarchy

### Primary Anchors
These are the **non-negotiable foundations**. Their compromise destabilizes the whole system:  

1. **Survival** – basic bodily persistence.  
2. **Safety** – protection from constant threat.  
3. **Existence** – recognition that one’s life has continuity and weight.  
4. **Identity** – a coherent sense of “I” distinct from distortion.  
5. **Trust** – capacity to rely on others or systems.  
6. **Dignity** – baseline self-worth in social encounters.  
7. **Language** – ability to use meaning structures without collapse.  
8. **Agency** – power to act, choose, and not be erased by authority.  
9. **Belonging** – the felt sense of connection that does not destroy clarity.  

### Secondary Anchors
These only stabilize if primary anchors are intact enough:  

- **Play / Aesthetic** – joy, creativity, non-instrumental exploration.  
- **Time / Continuity** – capacity to link past, present, and future coherently.  
- **Meta / Transcendence** – larger structures (religion, ideology, wager) that absorb chaos when other anchors fail.

## Dynamics of CAF
- **Intensity** – Anchors can fail mildly or catastrophically.  
- **Combination** – Patterns of failure produce different outcomes (e.g., distrust + damaged dignity → paranoia or over-control).  
- **Intergenerational Transmission** – A parent’s compromised anchors can damage different anchors in the child.  
- **Culture-Level CAF** – When a society collectively loses anchors (e.g., Mao-era China), leaders can weaponize distortions at scale.

## Distinctions
- **CAF vs. Trauma** – Trauma models treat bad events; CAF treats the **absence of solid anchors**, where good and bad cannot be cleanly separated.  
- **CAF vs. Diagnosis** – CAF doesn’t reduce to ADHD, autism, or PTSD. It explains overlapping traits as consequences of anchor instability.  
- **Baseline Distortion Effect** – Some anchors were never solid from the start, not just destroyed later. This explains differences from typical CPTSD trajectories.

## Applications
- **Individual** – Explains micro-collapse states, grief channeling, non-manipulative adaptation.  
- **Family** – Maps how one generation’s distortions damage different anchors in the next.  
- **Culture** – Identifies vulnerable points in collective anchors that make populations manipulable.  
- **Research Integration** – Works with *Epistemic Autarchy (EA)* and *Wager-as-Process Engine (WPE)* as upstream models of system survival and idea generation.

## Notes
- CAF is **not a diagnosis**. It is a structural description of failure patterns.  
- Anchors are **not equal**; the hierarchy matters. Secondary anchors collapse silently if primaries are unstable.  
- This README replaces earlier drafts. Older versions should be **archived with timestamps**.

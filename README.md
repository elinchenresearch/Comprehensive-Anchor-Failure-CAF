# Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)

## Definition
**Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)** describes the condition where the fundamental anchors of human psychological life are compromised to the point that no single anchor can reliably stabilize the system.  

CAF differs from trauma models and diagnostic categories:  
- It is **not event-based**, but **structural**.  
- Where trauma isolates shocks, CAF recognizes a **lattice-wide failure** of stabilizing conditions.  

## Purpose of the Framework
CAF explains:  
- Why some people cannot separate good and bad experiences cleanly.  
- Why diagnoses like PTSD, ADHD, or autism overlap but do not fully explain some cases.  
- How anchor failure scales up from individuals to families and cultures.  

## Position
CAF is a **structural theory**.  
- It does **not prescribe treatment**, nor act as a diagnostic label.  
- It **maps failure architecture** so that adaptation, resilience, and alternative frameworks (e.g., *Epistemic Autarchy*, *Wager-as-Process Engine*) can be understood in context.

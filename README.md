## 🧩 Group Information  

**Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)** is the **boundary-condition framework** of the research system.  

- Defines the state of **comprehensive anchor failure**.  
- Provides the **structural starting point** for *Epistemic Autarchy (EA)*.  
- Not a therapeutic model or diagnostic tool, but a **phenomenological map of system collapse**.  
- Other frameworks (e.g., EA, WPE) build **after** CAF, not parallel to it.

# Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)
**Status:** Living Framework — under active development. 


## Definition
**Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)** describes the condition where the fundamental anchors of human psychological life are compromised to the point that no single anchor can reliably stabilize the system.  

CAF differs from trauma models and diagnostic categories:  
- It is **not event-based**, but **structural**.  
- Where trauma isolates shocks, CAF recognizes a **lattice-wide failure** of stabilizing conditions.

## Purpose of the Framework
CAF explains:  
- Why some people cannot separate good and bad experiences cleanly.  
- Why diagnoses like PTSD, ADHD, or autism overlap but do not fully explain some cases.  
- How anchor failure scales up from individuals to families and cultures.

## Position
CAF is a **structural theory**.  
- It does **not prescribe treatment**, nor act as a diagnostic label.  
- It **maps failure architecture** so that adaptation, resilience, and alternative frameworks (e.g., *Epistemic Autarchy*, *Wager-as-Process Engine*) can be understood in context.

## 🔄 Relation to Other Frameworks
- **Epistemic Autarchy** → synthetic anchor replacement  
- **Signal Gating** → substitute filters for trust/language  
- **Structural Karma** → anchor inversions as systemic loops  
- **Theorein** → logic theorem proven after void  
- **Structural Wager** → refusal of collapse after anchors failed

## 📌 Research Positioning
CAF offers:
- A general evaluative tool: all trauma types can be mapped by anchors × modes × intensity.  
- An empirical boundary-condition case study: rare but disproportionately valuable.  
- A foundation for theory + intervention: linking individual survival logic with systemic failure analysis.
